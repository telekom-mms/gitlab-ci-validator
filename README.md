# Automated linting scanner

Background: We wanted to scan all our GitLab projects for a valid gitlab-ci.yml.

This repo runs a CI Job which scans all accessible repositories if their gitlab-ci.yml is valid and creates a ticket with the scan result if it is invalid..

If you fixed the findings you can close the created issue and this job will automatically reopen and update the existing ticket if there are new issues found.

## Documentation

Please have a look at our official documentation: [https://github.com/telekom-mms/gitlab-linting-scanner](https://github.com/telekom-mms/gitlab-linting-scanner)

## Contributing
